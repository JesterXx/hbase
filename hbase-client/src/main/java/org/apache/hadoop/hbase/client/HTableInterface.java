   * slower but safer.
   * <p>
   * Turning off {@code #autoFlush} means that multiple {@link Put}s will be
   * accepted before any RPC is actually sent to do the write operations. If the
   * application dies before pending writes get flushed to HBase, data will be
   * lost.
   * <p>
   * When you turn {@code #autoFlush} off, you should also consider the
   * {@code #clearBufferOnFail} option. By default, asynchronous {@link Put}
   * requests will be retried on failure until successful. However, this can
   * pollute the writeBuffer and slow down batching performance. Additionally,
   * you may want to issue a number of Put requests and call
   * {@link #flushCommits()} as a barrier. In both use cases, consider setting
   * clearBufferOnFail to true to erase the buffer after {@link #flushCommits()}
   * has been called, regardless of success.
   * <p>
   * In other words, if you call {@code #setAutoFlush(false)}; HBase will retry N time for each
   *  flushCommit, including the last one when closing the table. This is NOT recommended,
   *  most of the time you want to call {@code #setAutoFlush(false, true)}.
